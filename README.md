This is a "simple" RobotKarol remake (uncomplete). It's made in C and should (if everything works as intended) be compatible with linux and windows (idk about mac so probably not but idk)
To compile this so it works on your system you can use (LINUX) "gcc -o robotkarolrewrite c_RobotKarolRewrite_Program.c" then run the program with ./robotkarolrewrite
On (WINDOWS) you have to use mingw64 or something that can compile the program.

It currently has support for player controls / movement, custom field size and ansi colors.
Nothing else is currently implemented, this is very early in development.
